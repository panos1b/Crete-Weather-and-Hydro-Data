# Meteorological and Hydrological Data from Crete

## Overview

This dataset contains **raw hydrological and meteorological data** collected from various monitoring stations. The data includes parameters such as temperature, conductivity, water level, and other relevant measurements. It has been provided as-is, without any processing or correction, which may result in occasional errors due to signal transmission issues. These errors are expected to be transient and should not significantly affect the overall data.

For more information about the original data, you can contact the **Directorate of Waters** of the Decentralized Administration of Crete at:

## Data Description

The dataset includes raw data for hydrological and meteorological parameters. The exact content varies between stations but typically includes measurements of temperature, conductivity, water level, and other station-specific parameters.

Please note that the data is unprocessed, which means occasional **"errors"** may appear due to transmission problems or sensor issues. These errors are expected to be transient and do not significantly affect the overall dataset.

## Changes Made to the Original Data

The dataset has been modified to ensure greater consistency and accessibility. The following changes were made:

1. **File Structure and Naming**  
   - Columns in the data files have been **renamed and rearranged** to follow a more consistent pattern across the dataset.  
   - For more details on the specific structure, refer to the local readme files within each folder.

2. **Station and File Names**  
   - The names of the stations and files are now written in **Latin characters**, following the **ISO 843 (ΕΛΟΤ 743)** standard for Greek-to-Latin transcription. This is a change from the previous naming convention.

3. **Data Combination**  
   - Data from some stations has been **combined**.

4. **Water Quality Data**  
   - Water quality data is provided **raw and unprocessed**, exactly as received from the original source.

5. **Column Addition**  
   - Some data was missing specific columns. These were added and set as stars (no data)

## Data Access

The data is organized by station and can be found in **multiple folders**. Each folder contains data specific to a particular station, and local readme files provide further details about each station’s dataset.

## Usage

This dataset is intended for use in hydrological and meteorological analysis, research, or related fields. When using this data, please ensure proper attribution to the original source or me depending on what is relevant. See license file!
